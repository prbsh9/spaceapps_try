          Understanding the Water Cycle

          The complete cycle of water on earth is quite an interesting process.
          The perpetual process of rain which might seem instinctive to many,
          has a number of processes to go through. Sea water (inclusive of
          ocean) is the main water source in the planet, however, due to high
          concentration of water, the water isnâ€™t drinkable. In fact, the ocean,
          the largest source of water, is the end point of all the water
          resources like rivers. Only the fresh water available through lakes,
          rivers and glaciers which contain acceptable levels of salt suitable
          for drinking. Even though almost 70% of earth is made up of water,
          only a small amount of water is suitable for drinking.
