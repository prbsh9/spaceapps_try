            Welcome to Section 1 of our educational journey. In this section, we
            will explore the critical concepts of climate change and the
            intricate pathways that water takes across our planet. Understanding
            these fundamentals is essential for comprehending the broader
            picture of climate and water resource management.

          <p>
            In this section, we have introduced the concepts of climate change
            and water paths. We've highlighted the importance of these concepts
            in the context of freshwater resource management and their
            connection to global climate patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we proceed through this educational journey, we will delve deeper
            into these topics and explore how data and visualizations can help
            us understand the complex relationship between climate change and
            water paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, due to various factors, there has been a substantial change
            in the freshwater distribution pattern of earth.
